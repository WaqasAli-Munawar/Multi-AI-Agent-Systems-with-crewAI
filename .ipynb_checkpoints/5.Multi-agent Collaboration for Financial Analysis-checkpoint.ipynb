      " Apple expands Self Service Repair Diagnostics support to Europe Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair — a software tool that enables users to troubleshoot issues — is now available in 32 European countries, including the U.K., France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Launched in the U.S. in December 2023, Diagnostics gives users the same ability as Apple Authorized Service Providers and Independent Repair Providers to test products for optimal parts functionality and performance, and it helps identify which parts may need repair. With this expansion, Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair now supports iPhone, Mac, and Studio Display models in 33 countries and 24 languages. Diagnostics is part of Apple’s ongoing effort to extend the lifespan of Apple products. While Apple is committed to providing safe and affordable repair options, designing and building long-lasting products remains the top priority. The best type of repair for customers and the planet is one that is never needed. Today, Apple published a whitepaper explaining the company’s principles for designing for longevity — a careful balance between product durability and repairability. Customers can access Apple Diagnostics to better understand whether their product needs repair. They can begin the session on a second product and check the status and performance on the device that may need repair. After beginning the session and following the onscreen prompts, customers will know whether their products need repair and which parts need to be replaced. Launched in April 2022, Self Service Repair gives anyone with relevant experience repairing electronic devices access to the manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers. Self Service Repair supports 42 Apple products, and now includes MacBook Air models powered by M3. Next year, Canada will become the 34th country in which Apple offers Self Service Repair. \n",

Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 unleashes the remarkable capabilities of the new iPad Pro with the outrageously fast M4 chip, enabling up to 2x faster rendering and supporting up to 4x more streams of ProRes RAW than with M1. With the all-new Live Multicam feature, users can wirelessly connect and preview up to four cameras at once, all in one place. Using a combination of iPhone and iPad devices, users will have a director’s view of each camera and manual control of their preferences using the all-new pro app Final Cut Camera. Final Cut Camera powers Live Multicam and also works as a standalone recording app on iPhone and iPad, with the ability to adjust settings like manual focus, shutter speed, ISO, and more.1\n",
      " For more storage flexibility while working with large files, Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 now supports external projects, a top-requested feature.2 Users can create new projects or open an existing project without taking up internal storage space. Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 also supports the new Apple Pencil Pro, leveraging barrel roll for more precise control of Live Drawing tools, and squeeze to quickly pull up brushes and settings. With Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8, users can take their professional workflow to the next level. Harnessing the power of the Neural Engine in Apple silicon, new AI features come to Final Cut Pro: Enhance Light and Color, and Smooth Slo-Mo. Enhance Light and Color automatically adjusts video for color correction, while Smooth Slo-Mo intelligently blends video frames for the highest-quality movement. Also, new organizational tools improve efficiencies in post-production workflows, including custom names for color corrections and video effects in the inspector; the ability to search for and navigate to clips with missing media or effects in the timeline index; and text-based timeline search with information like reel, scene, camera angle, and more. Final Cut Pro for iPad 23 and Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.84 are now available as free updates for existing users. For new users, Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 is available on the App Store for $4.99 (U.S.) per month or $49 (U.S.) per year, and Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 is available on the Mac App Store for $299.99 (U.S.). \n",

      " Apple Developer Academy introduces AI training for all students and alumni New core curriculum will benefit Apple Developer Academy students and alumni in Brazil, Indonesia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United States starting this fall Today Apple announced it will train all Apple Developer Academy students and mentors on technologies and tools that take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI). Apple Developer Academy alumni will also have the opportunity to take part in this training. The new core curriculum will be provided to thousands of students and alumni across 18 Developer Academies in six countries as the academy continues to increase opportunities for developers, designers, and entrepreneurs looking to embark on careers in the growing iOS app economy and beyond. Dedicated curriculum on AI joins the academy’s program as a foundational skill, extending essential competencies in coding, professional skills, design, and marketing that are offered across the world and aim to help students learn important skills to contribute to their local businesses and communities. Apple Developer Academy curriculum also incorporates Apple’s values throughout coursework, encouraging students to design inclusively and make a positive impact in the world. “At Apple, we see coding as a universal language and believe in empowering developers, creators, and entrepreneurs across the world with tools and technologies that will allow them to create phenomenal experiences,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “With the introduction of curriculum dedicated to AI and other new technologies, we’re excited to see what students will build to share with their communities and the world.” Beginning this fall, every Apple Developer Academy student will benefit from custom-built curriculum that teaches them how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models across Apple devices. Courses will include the fundamentals of AI technologies and frameworks; Core ML and its ability to deliver fast performance on Apple devices; and guidance on how to build and train AI models from the ground up. Students will learn from guided curriculum and project-based assignments that include assistance from hundreds of mentors and more than 12,000 academy alumni worldwide. With the introduction of new Apple technologies and APIs announced at WWDC24, students will also have even more access to tools that empower them to build exceptional projects and apps. This includes Xcode 16, which sets a new standard for developer productivity. These features and performance enhancements also include Swift Assist, which serves as a companion for all of a developer’s coding tasks, and easily allows students to explore new frameworks and experiment with new ideas. Additionally, Swift 6 introduces new capabilities aimed at enhancing code clarity and making concurrent programming easier. Apple is part of every stage of the student journey, whether it’s exploring the fundamentals of app development in Apple’s global Foundations program, improving their skills at Apple Developer Academies, or taking their apps to the next level. \n",
